### New page HTML boilerplate
remember to change title and add a body

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <main class="content">
            <h1>Heading</h1>
        </main>
        <nav class="bottom-nav" id="bottomNav"></nav>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
